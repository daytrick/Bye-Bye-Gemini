# Bye Bye, Gemini
_A Google Chrome extension for removing the AI overview from Google searches._

**Why?**
<br>
I don't trust its summaries. Yes, it now has links to wherever it pulled the text from, but I have to actively follow those and evaluate how trustworthy they are. In contrast, I can see the source of real search results at a glance. 
<br>
It's also ugly and distracting.

**Isn't it easier to just... switch to a different search engine?**
<br>
Yes. Baby steps. 
<br>
It could also be a funny ship of Theseus thing... how many changes can I make to Chrome (via extensions, whether mine or other people's) until it barely resembles Google Chrome anymore?

**Cool. How do I use it?**
1. Download the repo.
2. Open up Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory to which you downloaded the repo.

**Why isn't there an on/off toggle?**
<br>
I always want it on.
